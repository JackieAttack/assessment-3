    <p>My neighborhood is a quiet little suburb located in Clearfield Utah. I've only lived here for a few months, but compared to the rundown cockroach infested appartment I where I was living previously (in downtown Salt Lake City) it's not bad.</p>
    <p>It's kind of a developing area, but you can get everything you need here and it's not too expensive.</p>

        <p>The restaurants in Clearfield aren't as good as the one's in SLC, but there are a few good finds.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.haruramen.us/">Haru Ramen</a>: Great ramen and japanese food.</li>
            <li><a href="https://tasteofindiautah.com/">Taste of India</a>: A good indian option.</li>
            <li><a href="https://chriscafe.net/">Chris' Cafe</a>: I like their eggs benedict. Kinda busy in the morning.</li>
        </ul>
